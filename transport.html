                <h3>Flights</h3>
                <p>Flying into Taniti is the most common way to get here. The airport in Taniti is relatively small and currently only serves smaller aircraft. There are plans for that to change in the near future. The airport is also the central hub for car rental options if that is the desired plan for transportation around the island while you're here.</p>

                <h3>Pedestrian</h3>
                <p>Taniti is a small island of less than 500 square miles, however that is a much bigger space to cover than it sounds if you're solely walking. It is very easy to plan adventure filled days without needing major transportation. There are also many day use options that keep the faster than pedestrian options very affordable also.</p>
